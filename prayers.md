# ✝️ The Lord's Prayer

**Our Father in heaven,**  
Hallowed be Your name.  
Your kingdom come,  
Your will be done,  
On earth as it is in heaven.  

Give us today our daily bread.  
Forgive us our debts,  
As we forgive our debtors.  

And lead us not into temptation,  
But deliver us from evil.  

For Yours is the kingdom,  
The power, and the glory forever.  
**Amen.**

# ✝️ Psalm 23

**The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.**  
He makes me lie down in green pastures.  
He leads me beside still waters.  
He restores my soul.  

He leads me in paths of righteousness  
For His name's sake.  

Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,  
I will fear no evil,  
For You are with me;  
Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.  

You prepare a table before me  
In the presence of my enemies;  
You anoint my head with oil;  
My cup overflows.  

Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me  
All the days of my life,  
And I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever.  
**Amen.**
